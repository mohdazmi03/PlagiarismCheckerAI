# Plagiarism Checker and Chatbot Tool

## Overview
The **Plagiarism Checker and Chatbot Tool** is a web-based application built with **Streamlit** and powered by **Ollama's Gemma2:2b model**.

### ‚úÖ Multi-format File Support
- Supports text extraction and analysis from **PDFs and Word (.docx) files**.

### ‚úÖ Interactive Chatbot
- Offers insights on **plagiarism detection** and **NLP-related plagiarism topics**.
